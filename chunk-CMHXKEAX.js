This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light", which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. The presentation speech began by mentioning "his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time".

It was long reported that in accord with the divorce settlement,[2] the Nobel Prize money had been deposited in a Swiss bank account for his wife Mileva Mari\u0107 to invest for herself and their two sons, while she could only use the capital by agreement with Einstein. However, personal correspondence made public in 2006[3] shows that he invested much of it in the United States, and saw much of it wiped out in the Great Depression. Ultimately, however, he paid Mari\u0107 more money than he received with the prize.[4] On November 12, 1913, Einstein was granted full membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences. On March 28, 1933, he resigned membership, explaining in a letter to the academy that he did not want to be associated with the Prussian government of the time.[5] On November 12, 1919, the University of Rostock awarded an honorary doctorate of medicine (Dr. med. h.c.) to Einstein, on the occasion of its 500th anniversary and following a suggestion by Moritz Schlick. This is the only honorary doctorate he received from a German university.[6] In 1921, Einstein accepted a Doctor of Science degree from the University of Manchester. In addition to receiving the degree, Einstein gave a lecture in Manchester on June 9. [7] In 1925 the Royal Society awarded Einstein the Copley Medal.[8] In 1926, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.[9] In 1929, Max Planck presented Einstein with the Max Planck medal of the German Physical Society in Berlin, for extraordinary achievements in theoretical physics.[10] In 1931, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, In 1934 Einstein gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture.[11][12] In 1936, Einstein was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal for his extensive work on relativity and the photo-electric effect.[10] The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics named 2005 the "World Year of Physics" in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of the annus mirabilis papers.[13] The chemical element 99, einsteinium, was named for him in August 1955, four months after Einstein's death.[14][15] 2001 Einstein is an inner main belt asteroid discovered on 5 March 1973.[16] In 1999 Time magazine named him the Person of the Century,[17][18] ahead of Mahatma Gandhi and Franklin Roosevelt, among others. In the words of a biographer, "to the scientifically literate and the public at large, Einstein is synonymous with genius".[19] Also in 1999, an opinion poll of 100 leading physicists ranked Einstein the "greatest physicist ever".[20] A Gallup poll recorded him as the fourth most admired person of the 20th century in the U.S.[21] In 1990, his name was added to the Walhalla temple for "laudable and distinguished Germans",[22] which is located in Donaustauf in Bavaria.[23] The United States Postal Service honored Einstein with a Prominent Americans series (1965\u20131978) 8\xA2 postage stamp. In 2008, Einstein was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[24] In 2018, Einstein was an inaugural inductee into the Royal Albert Hall's Walk of Fame. In October 1933 he made a speech before a packed out British audience in the Hall on his fear of the looming crisis in Europe, and in recognition of this his name was among those viewed as "key players" in the building's history.[25][26] The bust of Albert Einstein, installed in Mexico City's Parque M\xE9xico, commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.[27] Mount Einstein, a massive mountain in Alaska, was named in his honor in 1955.[28]`),s(7,"br"),e(),t(8,"h2"),i(9,`Things named after Einstein

The Albert Einstein Award (sometimes called the Albert Einstein Medal because it is accompanied with a gold medal) is an award in theoretical physics, established to recognize high achievement in the natural sciences. It was endowed by the Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund in honor of Albert Einstein's 70th birthday. It was first awarded in 1951 and included a prize money of $15,000,[29][30] which was later reduced to $5,000.[31][32] The winner is selected by a committee (the first of which consisted of Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neumann and Weyl[33]) of the Institute for Advanced Study, which administers the award.[30] The Albert Einstein Medal is an award presented by the Albert Einstein Society in Bern, Switzerland. First given in 1979, the award is presented to people who have "rendered outstanding services" in connection with Einstein.[34] The Albert Einstein Peace Prize is given yearly by the Chicago, Illinois-based Albert Einstein Peace Prize Foundation. Winners of the prize receive $50,000.[35] The Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a research-intensive medical school located in the Morris Park neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. The Albert Einstein Science Park is located on the hill Telegrafenberg in Potsdam, Germany. The best known building in the park is the Einstein Tower which has a bronze bust of Einstein at the entrance. The Tower is an astrophysical observatory that was built to perform checks of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.[36] The Albert Einstein Memorial in central Washington, D.C. is a monumental bronze statue depicting Einstein seated with manuscript papers in hand. The statue, commissioned in 1979, is located in a grove of trees at the southwest corner of the grounds of the National Academy of Sciences on Constitution Avenue. `),e()(),t(12,"div",5)(13,"div",6)(14,"div",7)(15,"sub",8),i(16,"Israeli postage stamp (1956)"),e(),s(17,"img",9),e(),t(18,"div",7)(19,"sub",8),i(20,`U.S. postage stamp (1966)

The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955. In his final four years, Einstein was involved with the establishment of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. In 1979, the Albert Einstein Memorial was unveiled outside the National Academy of Sciences building in Washington, D.C. for the Einstein centenary. It was sculpted by Robert Berks. Einstein can be seen holding a paper with three of his most important equations: for the photoelectric effect, general relativity and mass-energy equivalence. Einstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the right had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university. Mount Einstein in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named in 1955.

Physicist Lev Landau ranked physicists from 0 to 5 on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius, with Newton and Einstein belonging in a "super league", with Newton receiving the highest ranking of 0, followed by Einstein with 0.5, while fathers of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac were ranked 1, with Landau himself a 2. Physicist Eugene Wigner noted that while John von Neumann had the quickest and most acute mind he ever knew, it was Einstein who had the more penetrating and original mind of the two, stating that: But Einstein's understanding was deeper than even Jancsi von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement. Einstein took an extraordinary pleasure in invention. Two of his greatest inventions are the Special and General Theories of Relativity; and for all of Jancsi's brilliance, he never produced anything so original. No modern physicist has. The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics declared 2005 the "World Year of Physics", also known as "Einstein Year", in recognition of Einstein's "miracle year" in 1905.

Einstein is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyles have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".[1] "Einstein" has become a byword for an extremely intelligent person. It may also be used ironically when someone states the obvious or demonstrates a lack of wisdom or intelligence (as in "Way to go, Einstein!") Many quotes that have become popular via the Internet have been misattributed to him, including "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result".[2][3]

In 1999, leading physicists voted Einstein the "greatest physicist ever".[4] His birthday, March 14, is also Pi Day, so called because 3/14 (March 14 in shorthand month-day format) corresponds to 3.14, the first three digits of the number Pi. The town of Princeton, New Jersey, where Einstein lived for more than 20 years, celebrates March 14 every year as "Princeton Pi Day and Einstein Birthday Party".[5]

The children's television show Little Einsteins and the educational toys and videos of the Baby Einstein series both use Einstein's name, though not his image. Iranian cartoonist and humorist Javad Alizadeh publishes a column titled "4D Humor" in his Persian monthly Humor & Caricature, which features cartoons, caricatures and stories on Einstein-related topics.[6] In 1991, he published in the column a comic book on Einstein's life and work, inspired mainly by the theory of relativity.[7] On Einstein's 72nd birthday on March 14, 1951, United Press photographer Arthur Sasse was trying to persuade him to smile for the camera, but having smiled for photographers many times that day, Einstein stuck out his tongue instead.[8] This photograph became one of the most popular ever taken of Einstein,[9][10] often used in merchandise depicting him in a lighthearted sense. Einstein enjoyed this photo and requested UPI to give him nine copies for personal use, one of which he signed for a reporter. On June 19, 2009, the original signed photograph was sold at auction for $74,324, a record for an Einstein picture at the time.[11] The photo was sold again on July 27, 2017 for $125,000.[12] Salesforce acquired a 20-year license in 2016 for $20 million to be the only business-oriented software company permitted to use his likeness. Einstein's likeness is used as a company mascot and his name is used for the company's artificial intelligence features.[13][14]

Einstein bequeathed his estate, as well as the use of his image (see personality rights), to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,[15] which from the mid-1980s has sponsored the Einstein Papers Project with the Princeton University Press. Einstein actively supported the university during his life and this support continues with the royalties received from licensing activities. GreenLight licences the commercial use of the name "Albert Einstein" and associated imagery and likenesses of Einstein, as agent for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As head licensee, the corporation can control commercial usage of Einstein's name and theoretically ensure compliance with certain standards (e.g., when Einstein's name is used as a trademark, the \u2122 symbol must be used).[16] In 2012, Judge Howard Matz of a United States district court found that although a General Motors advertisement featuring Einstein's image was "tasteless", it was not illegal. Judge Matz wrote that "the obviously humorous ad for the 2010 Terrain having been published 55 years or more after Einstein's death, it is unlikely that any viewer of it could reasonably infer that Einstein, or whoever succeeded to any right of publicity that Einstein may have had, was endorsing the GMC Terrain". Hebrew University asked that publicity rights be extended to the 70 years associated with copyright protection. Judge Matz declined, stating "the Ninth Circuit recently noted that Marilyn Monroe considered herself to belong 'to the Public and to the world'". He also stated: "There is no evidence that Albert Einstein saw himself that way, but he did become the symbol and embodiment of genius. His persona has become thoroughly ingrained in our cultural heritage. Now, nearly 60 years after his death, that persona should be freely available to those who seek to appropriate it as part of their own expression, even in tasteless ads".[17]

There is a persistent popular belief that Einstein was left-handed,[18] but there is no evidence that he was, and the belief has been called a myth.[19][20] Einstein wrote with his right hand[21] and authoritative sources state flatly that he was right-handed.[20][22] An autopsy on Einstein's brain showed a symmetry between the two hemispheres, rather than a left-sided dominance as is typical of most right-handed people or a right-sided dominance as found in most left-handed people.[19]

The 1988 film Young Einstein presents a fictionalized version of Einstein\u2019s early life. In this version, he is the son of a Tasmanian apple farmer who not only develops the theory of relativity, but also surfing and rock \u2018n roll. His theory, e=mc2 is shown as method for splitting beer atoms. Einstein was portrayed by Ludwig St\xF6ssel in the 1947 film The Beginning or the End. He was the subject (along with Arthur Eddington) of the BBC Two film Einstein and Eddington (featuring David Tennant as Eddington and Andy Serkis as Einstein, and detailing Einstein's development of his theories and Eddington's attempts to prove them)[28] and in Yahoo Serious's intentionally inaccurate biography of Einstein as an Australian in the film Young Einstein (although the movie is fictionalized).[29] An Einstein-like character appears in Nicolas Roeg's 1985 film Insignificance. Set in New York in 1953, the film includes a scene in which "The Professor" (played by Michael Emil), the character evidently representing Albert Einstein, discusses relativity with "The Actress" (Theresa Russell), a Marilyn Monroe-like character.[30] Einstein was portrayed by Walter Matthau in the 1994 romantic comedy film I.Q.[31] In the 2001 film A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, he was portrayed as a holographic personality called Dr. Know (voiced by Robin Williams).[32] In the film Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, he and the other bobbleheads live in the Air and Space Museum. The 2009 film The Nutcracker in 3D includes a character named Uncle Albert (played by Nathan Lane) who resembles Einstein, speaks with a German accent, and recites Albert Einstein quotes, but is never explicitly identified as Einstein.[33] The Star Wars character Yoda's wrinkles were modeled after Einstein's to give the impression of exceptional intelligence.[34] In the film Back to the Future, Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd and portrayed as a brilliant scientist, time traveler and inventor) has a dog named Einstein, who is named after Brown's favorite scientist and bears a superficial resemblance to him. Lloyd also credited Einstein as being his inspiration for the character.[35][36] In the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the Autobot Que sports an Einstein-inspired head design, including his wild hairstyle, dapper mustache, and eyes. However, his accent is often confused for being German because of these similarities. Like his G1 counterpart and Einstein alike, he is one of the most intelligent members of his team, and is an accomplished scientist and inventor. However, his onscreen name "Que" was derived from Professor Q, a James Bond character, who also inspired Wheeljack/Que's overall character. In the 2014 CGI-animated film, Mr. Peabody & Sherman, Einstein only appeared in the film's climax, voice-portrayed by Mel Brooks. Einstein was portrayed by David Shackleton in the 2018 film Holmes & Watson. In the 2023 film Oppenheimer, Einstein was portrayed by Tom Conti.[37]

A holographic representation of Einstein (played by Jim Norton) appeared in two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He first appears to debate physics with Reginald Barclay in "The Nth Degree". Norton returns in the first part of "Descent". The episode starts on the Enterprise with a game of poker being played by holodeck representations of Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking (portrayed by himself). All are programmed by Lt. Commander Data, playing as the fourth person in the game.[38] In Dexter's Laboratory, Einstein is boy genius Dexter's hero. The Voyagers! episode "The Travels of Marco...and Friends" begins with Bogg and Jeff landing in New York in 1930 and saving Einstein from a potentially fatal accident. In The Super Mario Bros. Super Show, Einstein was played by Ed Metzger. In Touched by an Angel, Einstein was played by Harold Gould. In Eureka, the titular town was established when President Harry S. Truman commissioned development of a top-secret lab, staffed by Albert Einstein, after World War II and it became home to the scientists and their families working there.[39] In the Rick and Morty episode "A Rickle in Time", time-traveling monsters beat up Einstein, whom they had mistaken for Rick Sanchez.[40] In Genius, Einstein is portrayed by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Flynn as the elder and younger Einstein respectively. Einstein is portrayed by John Rubinstein in the Legends of Tomorrow episode "Out of Time".[41] He is later mentioned in the episode "The Curse of the Earth Totem", where he was trapped in the ice age due to being displaced in time. The German Netflix series Dark begins a with a quote about the perception of time by Einstein. Einstein is portrayed by Eric Charters in episode 11 of season 13 "Staring Blindly into the Future" (January 13, 2020) of the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries where he explains the theory of general relativity. He is also mentioned in episode 13 of season 12 "Murdoch and the Undetectable Man" (January 28, 2019).
